## Lab Questions
The variable harry was stored at address 0x7fff5fbff4a8, or 140734799803560. The variable bluejay was stored at 0x7fff5fbff498, or 140734799803544. It seems then that the stack grows down in memory, meaning that local variables are stored in sequentially lower memory addresses. The local variable y is stored closer to the top of the stack because it would have a lower address, meaning that it has been allocated most recently and is at the top of the stack.
